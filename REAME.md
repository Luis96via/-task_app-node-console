# INFORMATION

This is a task application made in console, with Node.js.

This application works like a CRUD, thus using files instead of using a DB. Thus, we consume the records saved in the Json file and in this way, when the application is closed, the previously registered tasks are saved, in addition to their status of whether they are finished or not.

This application has colors to make it more user friendly to use it.
